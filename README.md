Leveraging the web framework provided by go-zero allowed me to effortlessly build high-performance microservices, while kafka-go served as a convenient Go language Kafka client library. Throughout the hands-on experience, I explored effective strategies for managing consumer offsets to ensure accurate message processing. Additionally, I demonstrated the application of the rebalance mechanism in response to changes in consumer group membership. This exercise aims to understand how Kafka Consumer handles offsets and addresses rebalancing challenges.
